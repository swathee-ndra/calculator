# calculator
This is my first calculator project, originally made during my 12th grade, now redesigned with a modern look and improved functionality.
It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and also includes:

AC → Clear all

CLR → Remove last digit

Keyboard support for easier input

Responsive design for both desktop and mobile

Highlighted operator buttons for better usability

This project holds a special place for me as it’s where I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it’s now upgraded to a professional, GitHub-hosted version.
